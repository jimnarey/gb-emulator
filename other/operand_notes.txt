  Sources

cc - flag condition (C, NC, Z, NZ)
b - bit
d, dd - 8, 16bit *destination register*
e - 8bit signed, 2's complement
f - 8 x special call locations, (Page 0)
n, nn - 8, 16bit binary number
r - 8bit register
s - 8bit source register or memory location
sb - bit in a specific 8bit register or memory location
ss - any 16bit source register or memory location



Are these ever distinct operands?
Z, H, N, C - Flags
NC, NZ - not C and not Z


  Make sure an error is thrown if the operand isn't found/recognised  

Check usages of 'C' as an operand. Always register or sometimes flag? 
ADC, SBC, SCF, CCF use carry flag
